## Installation

```

Additionally, to enable Hardhat CLI completion, use the following command:

```bash

## Usage

### Local Chain

The system will auto-generate 5 private keys. If you want to add your development private keys to the system, use the following command before starting the node:

```bash
hh vars set DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

To start the development node, you can use the following command:

```bash
hh node
```

This will start the local Conflux node and fund the genesis accounts on Core. Other available commands:

To stop the node:

```bash
hh node --stop
```

To get the status:

```bash
hh node --status
```

To get the balance of the configured keys:

```bash
hh balance
```

To add funds to a specific address on the local node:

```bash
hh faucet 100 0x1231231231123
```

The devkit utility is available. For more details, refer to the [Conflux Devkit README](https://github.com/SPCFXDA/conflux-devkit/blob/main/README.md).

Once the accounts are funded and the chain is running, you can invoke the deployment examples with the following commands:

### Deploy to eSpace

```bash
hh ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/LockModule.ts --network confluxESpaceLocal
```

This will use LockModule.ts with Ignition to deploy the contract on the local eSpace.

### Deploy to Core

```bash
hh run scripts/LockDeploy_Core.ts --network confluxCoreLocal
```

This will use LockDeploy_Core.ts with js-conflux-sdk to deploy on the local Core.
